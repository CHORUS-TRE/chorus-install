## Install

1. Set variables for your usecase

    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Edit this file as needed.

1. Source your env file
    ```
    source .env
    ```

1. Initialize, plan and apply stage 0

    ```
    cd stage_00
    terraform login
    terraform workspace show
    terraform init
    terraform plan -out="stage_00.plan"
    terraform apply "stage_00.plan"
    ```

1. Initialize, plan and apply stage 1

    ```
    cd ../stage_01
    terraform login
    terraform workspace show
    terraform init
    terraform plan -out="stage_01.plan"
    terraform apply "stage_01.plan"
    ```

    > **_NOTE:_** The ```terraform apply``` command can take several minutes to complete

1. Fetch the loadbalancer IP address using ```terraform output loadbalancer_ip```

1. Update your DNS with the loadbalancer IP address

1. Fetch the Harbor URL using ```terraform output harbor_url_admin_login```

1. Make sure Harbor can be accessed using your browser, then proceed with stage 2

    > **_NOTE:_** It takes some time for the certificates to be signed and trusted, hence TLS server verification is currently disabled for Terraform providers used in stage 2. If you chose to enable the verification, you might hit the following error: ```tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority```

1. Initialize, plan and apply stage 2
    ```
    cd ../stage_02
    terraform login
    terraform workspace show
    terraform init
    terraform plan -out="stage_02.plan"
    terraform apply "stage_02.plan"
    ```

1. Make sure the ```output.yaml``` file appeared. At this stage, the build cluster is complete. You can proceed with stage 3 to add a remote cluster.

1. Initialize, plan and apply stage 3 (you might need to re-apply stage 0 if the remote cluster related variables were not set previously)
    ```
    cd ../stage_03
    terraform login
    terraform workspace show
    terraform init
    terraform plan -out="stage_03.plan"
    terraform apply "stage_03.plan"
    ``` 

1. Initialize, plan and apply stage 4
    ```
    cd ../stage_04
    terraform login
    terraform workspace show
    terraform init
    terraform plan -out="stage_04.plan"
    terraform apply "stage_04.plan"
    ```

1. Find all the URLs, usernames and passwords needed in the ```output.yaml``` file

    > **_NOTE:_** The applications' sync status might be in an unkown state for a few minutes because ArgoCD fails to connect to the Harbor Helm registry. This is caused by the fact that Harbor initially serves an invalid certificate, and it takes some time for the correct certificate to be provisioned. Also, you might be hitting Let's Encrypt rate limit if you've reinstalled the services too many times lately.

    > **_NOTE:_** As ArgoCD takes over the responsibility for the components that were already deployed (e.g. Keycloak, Harbor), their related services will experience a short unavailability period.

## Handle existing resources

In the case where Terraform fails due to existing resources not managed by Terraform,
you can [import](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import) them.

Error example

```
│ Error: namespaces "ingress-nginx" already exists
│
│   with module.ingress_nginx.kubernetes_namespace.ingress_nginx,
│   on ../modules/ingress_nginx/main.tf line 3, in resource "kubernetes_namespace" "ingress_nginx":
│    3: resource "kubernetes_namespace" "ingress_nginx" {
```

Import command

```
terraform import module.ingress_nginx.kubernetes_namespace.ingress_nginx ingress-nginx 
```

Where 
- ```module.ingress_nginx.kubernetes_namespace.ingress_nginx``` is the Terraform object to import the resource into
- ```ingress-nginx``` is the resource ID


## Uninstall

1. Destroy the infrastructure

    ```
    cd stage_04
    terraform destroy
    cd ../stage_03
    terraform destroy
    cd ../stage_02
    terraform destroy
    cd ../stage_01
    terraform destroy
    cd ..
    ```

1. Make sure the uninstallation was successful
    ```
    kubectl get ns
    # Expected output: system-level namespace only (e.g. kube-***)
    ```

    ```
    helm list -A
    # Expected output: system-level charts only (e.g. kube-***)
    ```

1. Double check the PVCs and PVs, you might want to clear up those too

> **_NOTE:_** If something goes wrong during the uninstallation, you can run
```./scripts/nuke.sh``` to destroy everything without relying on Terraform
